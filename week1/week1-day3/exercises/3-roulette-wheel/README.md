Write a program that takes the player's bet. The player should be able to bet on any number of spaces, as well as red, black, odd, even, 1-18, and 19-36. 

We are modeling the American Roulette board, which includes a "00" space.

Take a look at the betting odds table for roulette [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette#Bet_odds_table)

The program should display their odds against winning in real time as they choose places.

When the user decides to roll, they should get the random result and their payout if any. You do not need to implement betting, although you can if want to! You can represent payout as a multiplier of the amount they won over the amount they bet.

Make it fun!
