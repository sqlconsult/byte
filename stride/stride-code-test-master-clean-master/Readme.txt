Stride Code Test
================

Should you have any issues, questions or improvements please do not
hesitate to contact us by emailing codetest@stridenyc.com.

-   Note: please do not share this test or your solution with anyone for
    they are intended to be private. If you decide to put it on github
    via fork or import, please do so in a private repository.

Requirements

-   You may complete the test in a language of your choice, though Java,
    Ruby, or JavaScript/Node are preferred.
-   Please refrain from using third party libraries in your solution,
    with the exception that you may use testing related libraries and a
    basic CSV file parsing library.
-   Please submit your solution in a zip file. We will not accept Github
    forks or links to code on Github or any similar host.
-   Please tell us what language you used to implement your solution.

Assessment

-   Your code will be assessed on the following:
    -   Design
    -   Correctness
    -   Code quality metrics such as cleanliness, readability,
        maintainability and simplicity. Please create a solution that
        you would consider to be good code.
    -   Test quality and maintainability.
    -   You will be assessed on the quality of your automated tests as
        much as by the quality of your code, please take time to include
        them.
    -   This is not a timed coding test. You will not be graded on how
        quickly you submit your solution. Please take your time in
        devising your solution.
-   We ARE NOT concerned with how fast the code performs. (It's a small
    chocolate store!)
-   Please write production quality code, don't just solve the problem
    quickly.
-   Style and aesthetics count! Good references for what we consider to
    be strong Object Oriented code are Sandi Metz's "Practial Object
    Oriented Design in Ruby" and code samples from it

Running Your Solution

-   Please tell us how to execute your program. We expect to be able to
    run it and for it to generate an output file.
-   Please ensure that any automated tests you submit can be executed
    easily and successfully (hint: use a build tool).

Anonymize Your Solution

All submitted code tests will be anonymized before they are given to an
assessor. To aid in this it is important that you do not add your name,
Github profile or any other identifying information to any file you
submit as a part of the solution (i.e. nothing in the submitted ZIP file
is to identify you).

The Problem
-----------

There is a chocolate store that sells white, dark, milk and sugar free
chocolate bars. When a shopper places an order for chocolate, store
staff specify the price of the chocolate and the number of wrappers that
must be returned in order to receive free chocolates. The price of the
chocolate and the number of wrappers required to receive a free
chocolate changes with every order as the shop is still experimenting
with how the promotion should work.

Promotion Rules

-   When a shopper trades the required number of:
-   milk wrappers they will receive one complimentary milk chocolate and
    one complimentary sugar free chocolate.
-   white wrappers they will receive one complimentary white chocolate
    and one complimentary sugar free chocolate.
-   sugar free wrappers they will receive one complimentary sugar free
    chocolate and one complimentary dark chocolate.
-   dark wrappers they will receive one complimentary dark chocolate.

The Orders File

Orders placed by different shoppers can be found in the CSV file
input/orders.csv. The first line of this file contains header
information, each subsequent line represents an order. The header format
is:

    cash, price, wrappers needed, type

-   Cash: the amount of cash the shopper has to spend on chocolate.

-   Price: the price of a single chocolate.

-   Wrappers needed: is the number of wrappers that must be traded in,
    in order to receive free chocolate. This number applies to each type
    of wrapper being turned in (e.g. a value of 3 means that 3 milk or 3
    white wrappers may be redeemed at once) and is independent of the
    type of chocolate being ordered.

-   Type: the type of chocolate the shopper is buying in that order.

There are four orders in the input/orders.csv file. Every line in
input/orders.csv is a separate order with a different price and number
of wrappers needed. Orders are independent of each other, the cash,
price and wrappers needed of one order does not affect any other order.

Instructions

Write a program which reads the contents of input/orders.csv. Using the
promotion rules, your program is to generate output to a file named
output/redemptions.csv. Each line in input/orders.csv is to result in a
line in output/redemptions.csv. Each line in the output file should have
the format:

    milk N,dark N,white N,sugar free N

Where N is the number of chocolates of that type they possess at the
conclusion of all possible trades. You are to assume that all shoppers
trade everything they can and therefore redeem as much chocolate as they
possibly can.

Given the data in input/orders.csv, a correct program will generate the
following output:

    milk 7,dark 0,white 0,sugar free 1
    milk 0,dark 3,white 0,sugar free 0
    milk 0,dark 3,white 0,sugar free 5
    milk 0,dark 1,white 5,sugar free 3

Example

input/orders.csv

        cash,price,wrappers needed,type
        14,2,6,"milk"

Using the above order as an example, the shopper has $14. Each chocolate
costs $2 so the shopper is able to buy 7 milk chocolates ($14/$2). The
promotion states that the shopper will receive a complimentary milk
chocolate for every 6 wrappers traded in (because wrappers needed is 6
for this order). The shopper has 7 wrappers, so can trade in 6 wrappers
and receives a complimentary milk chocolate. Additionally, the shopper
is given a complimentary sugar free chocolate. The shopper will end up
with 8 milk chocolates and 1 sugar free chocolate.

In this example, the file output/redemptions.csv should contain the
following:

output/redemptions.csv

    milk 8,dark 0,white 0,sugar free 1

More examples

input/orders.csv

    12,2,5,"milk"

output/redemptions.csv

    milk 7,dark 0,white 0,sugar free 1

The shopper buys 6 milk chocolates and trades in 5 wrappers to get 1
free milk chocolate. They also get one sugar free.

input/orders.csv

    12,4,4,"dark"

output/redemptions.csv

    milk 0,dark 3,white 0,sugar free 0

The shopper buys 3 dark chocolates, but since wrappers needed is 4 they
can't trade any wrappers in.

input/orders.csv

    6,2,2,"sugar free"

output/redemptions.csv

    milk 0,dark 3,white 0,sugar free 5

The shopper can buy 3 sugar free chocolates for $6. They can trade 2 of
their 3 wrappers and get 1 complimentary sugar free chocolate and 1
complimentary dark chocolate. The shopper now has 4 sugar free
chocolates, and one sugar free wrapper left from the first trade. They
use the leftover wrapper and the wrapper from the complimentary
sugar free chocolate to get another complimentary sugar free chocolate
and a complimentary dark chocolate. At this point the shopper has a
total of 5 sugar free chocolates. And since they got 2 dark chocolates,
they can trade both of those in for an extra dark. Final total: 5
sugar free chocolates, 3 dark chocolates.

input/orders.csv

    6,2,2,"white"

output/redemptions.csv

    milk 0,dark 1,white 5,sugar free 3

The shopper buys 3 white and trades in 2 white wrappers for 1 white and
1 sugar free. Now they can use the extra white wrapper to get another
white and another sugar free. Those 2 sugar free wrappers get another
sugar free and a dark.
